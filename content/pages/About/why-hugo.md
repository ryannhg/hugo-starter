It is powered by Go, which means it can rapidly rebuild an entire static website in milliseconds. Everytime you update your content, Hugo rapidly regenerates your site to provide the fastest possible experience to your users.</p><p>And <strong>better performance</strong> means <strong>happier users!</strong></p><h3>Assets have their own CDN</h3><p>Things like JS bundles and CSS bundles actually don't need to be regenerated everytime content is updated. That's why compiling JS should take place in a different process, and can be served on an entirely different site.</p><h3>Foresty.io</h3><p>I am personally comfortable updating content via Github. However, for many non-developer users, this can be an absolute nightmare. It's important to have a simple fronted interface to help content editors stay focused on creating content!</p><p>There are several reasons why Forestry.io is a great fit for this problem:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clean, modern UI</strong> - many legacy CMS platforms combine a distracting amount of user controls with a poor user feedback system. Foresty is responsive, and follows UX best practices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrated with Hugo</strong> - Forestry has built-in support and excellent documentation for working with an existing Hugo site.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rich Content Modeling</strong> - Every site has a unique set of information that is important to keep track of. Forestry makes modelling simple with templates and partials, and a focused set of field types and controls.</p></li></ul>"
